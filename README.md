# Omniverse Isaac Gym Reinforcement Learning Environments for Isaac Sim

### About this repository

This repository contains Reinforcement Learning examples that can be run with the latest release of [Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/overview.html). RL examples are trained using PPO from [rl_games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games) library and examples are built on top of Isaac Sim's `omni.isaac.core` and `omni.isaac.gym` frameworks.

### Installation

Follow the Isaac Sim [documentation](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_basic.html) to install the latest Isaac Sim release.

Once installed, this repository can be used as a python module, `omniisaacgymenvs`, with the python executable provided in Isaac Sim.

To install `omniisaacgymenvs`, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/OmniIsaacGymEnvs.git
```

Once cloned, locate the [python executable in Isaac Sim](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_python.html). By default, this should be `python.sh`. We will refer to this path as `PYTHON_PATH`.

To set a `PYTHON_PATH` variable in the terminal that links to the python executable, we can run a command that resembles the following. Make sure to update the paths to your local path.

```
For Linux: alias PYTHON_PATH=~/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-*/python.sh
For Windows: doskey PYTHON_PATH=C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\ov\pkg\isaac_sim-*\python.bat $*
```

Install `omniisaacgymenvs` as a python module for `PYTHON_PATH`:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m pip install -e .
```


### Running the examples

*Note: All commands should be executed from `omniisaacgymenvs/omniisaacgymenvs`.*

To train your first policy, run:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Cartpole
```

You should see an Isaac Sim window pop up. Once Isaac Sim initialization completes, the Cartpole scene will be constructed and simulation will start running automatically. The process will terminate once training finishes.


Here's another example - Ant locomotion - using the multi-threaded training script:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train_mt.py task=Ant
```

Note that by default, we show a Viewport window with rendering, which slows down training. You can choose to close the Viewport window during training for better performance. The Viewport window can be re-enabled by selecting `Window > Viewport` from the top menu bar.

To achieve maximum performance, you can launch training in `headless` mode as follows:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant headless=True
```

#### A Note on the Startup Time of the Simulation

Some of the examples could take a few minutes to load because the startup time linearly scales based on the number of environments. The startup time will
be optimized in the next release.


### Loading trained models // Checkpoints

Checkpoints are saved in the folder `runs/EXPERIMENT_NAME/nn` where `EXPERIMENT_NAME` 
defaults to the task name, but can also be overridden via the `experiment` argument.

To load a trained checkpoint and continue training, use the `checkpoint` argument:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=runs/Ant/nn/Ant.pth
```

To load a trained checkpoint and only perform inference (no training), pass `test=True` 
as an argument, along with the checkpoint name. To avoid rendering overhead, you may 
also want to run with fewer environments using `num_envs=64`:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=runs/Ant/nn/Ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

Note that if there are special characters such as `[` or `=` in the checkpoint names, 
you will need to escape them and put quotes around the string. For example,
`checkpoint="runs/Ant/nn/last_Antep\=501rew\[5981.31\].pth"`

We provide pre-trained checkpoints on the [Nucleus](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_nucleus/prod_nucleus/overview.html) server under `Assets/Isaac/2022.1/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints`. Run the following command
to launch inference with pre-trained checkpoint:

Localhost (To set up localhost, please refer to the [Isaac Sim installation guide](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/app_isaacsim/app_isaacsim/install_basic.html)):

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=omniverse://localhost/NVIDIA/Assets/Isaac/2022.1/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints/ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

Production server:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Ant checkpoint=http://omniverse-content-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Assets/Isaac/2022.1/Isaac/Samples/OmniIsaacGymEnvs/Checkpoints/ant.pth test=True num_envs=64
```

When running with a pre-trained checkpoint for the first time, we will automatically download the checkpoint file to `omniisaacgymenvs/checkpoints`. For subsequent runs, we will re-use the file that has already been downloaded, and will not overwrite existing checkpoints with the same name in the `checkpoints` folder.

## Training Scripts

All scripts provided in `omniisaacgymenvs/scripts` can be launched directly with `PYTHON_PATH`.

To test out a task without RL in the loop, run the random policy script with:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/random_policy.py task=Cartpole
```

This script will sample random actions from the action space and apply these actions to your task without running any RL policies. Simulation should start automatically after launching the script, and will run indefinitely until terminated.


To run a simple form of PPO from `rl_games`, use the single-threaded training script:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train.py task=Cartpole
```

This script creates an instance of the PPO runner in `rl_games` and automatically launches training and simulation. Once training completes (the total number of iterations have been reached), the script will exit. If running inference with `test=True checkpoint=<path/to/checkpoint>`, the script will run indefinitely until terminated. Note that this script will have limitations on interaction with the UI.


Lastly, we provide a multi-threaded training script that executes the RL policy on a separate thread than the main thread used for simulation and rendering:

```bash
PYTHON_PATH scripts/rlgames_train_mt.py task=Cartpole
```

This script uses the same RL Games PPO policy as the above, but runs the RL loop on a new thread. Communication between the RL thread and the main thread happens on threaded Queues. Simulation will start automatically, but the script will **not** exit when training terminates, except when running in headless mode. Simulation will stop when training completes or can be stopped by clicking on the Stop button in the UI. Training can be launched again by clicking on the Play button. Similarly, if running inference with `test=True checkpoint=<path/to/checkpoint>`, simulation will run until the Stop button is clicked, or the script will run indefinitely until the process is terminated.


### Configuration and command line arguments

We use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) to manage the config.
 
Common arguments for the training scripts are:

* `task=TASK` - Selects which task to use. Any of `AllegroHand`, `Ant`, `Cartpole`, `Humanoid`, `ShadowHand`, (these correspond to the config for each environment in the folder `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/task`)
* `train=TRAIN` - Selects which training config to use. Will automatically default to the correct config for the environment (ie. `<TASK>PPO`).
* `num_envs=NUM_ENVS` - Selects the number of environments to use (overriding the default number of environments set in the task config).
* `seed=SEED` - Sets a seed value for randomization, and overrides the default seed in the task config
* `pipeline=PIPELINE` - Which API pipeline to use. Defaults to `gpu`, can also set to `cpu`. When using the `gpu` pipeline, all data stays on the GPU. When using the `cpu` pipeline, simulation can run on either CPU or GPU, depending on the `sim_device` setting, but a copy of the data is always made on the CPU at every step.
* `sim_device=SIM_DEVICE` - Device used for physics simulation. Set to `gpu` (default) to use GPU and to `cpu` for CPU.
* `device_id=DEVICE_ID` - Device ID for GPU to use for simulation and task. Defaults to `0`. This parameter will only be used if `pipeline=gpu`.
* `rl_device=RL_DEVICE` - Which device / ID to use for the RL algorithm. Defaults to `cuda:0`, and follows PyTorch-like device syntax.
* `test=TEST`- If set to `True`, only runs inference on the policy and does not do any training.
* `checkpoint=CHECKPOINT_PATH` - Path to the checkpoint to load for training or testing.
* `headless=HEADLESS` - Whether to run in headless mode.
* `experiment=EXPERIMENT` - Sets the name of the experiment.
* `max_iterations=MAX_ITERATIONS` - Sets how many iterations to run for. Reasonable defaults are provided for the provided environments.

Hydra also allows setting variables inside config files directly as command line arguments. As an example, to set the minibatch size for a rl_games training run, you can use `train.params.config.minibatch_size=64`. Similarly, variables in task configs can also be set. For example, `task.env.episodeLength=100`.

#### Hydra Notes

Default values for each of these are found in the `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/config.yaml` file.

The way that the `task` and `train` portions of the config works are through the use of config groups. 
You can learn more about how these work [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/structured_config/config_groups/)
The actual configs for `task` are in `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/task/<TASK>.yaml` and for `train` in `omniisaacgymenvs/cfg/train/<TASK>PPO.yaml`. 

In some places in the config you will find other variables referenced (for example,
 `num_actors: ${....task.env.numEnvs}`). Each `.` represents going one level up in the config hierarchy.
 This is documented fully [here](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#variable-interpolation).

### Tensorboard

Tensorboard can be launched during training via the following command:
```bash
PYTHON_PATH -m tensorboard.main --logdir runs/EXPERIMENT_NAME/summaries
```

## Tasks

Source code for tasks can be found in `omniisaacgymenvs/tasks`. 

Each task follows the frameworks provided in `omni.isaac.core` and `omni.isaac.gym` in Isaac Sim.

Refer to [docs/framework.md](docs/framework.md) for how to create your own tasks.

Full details on each of the tasks available can be found in the [RL examples documentation](docs/rl_examples.md).
